        <h2>A Summary of Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Alexander Farlinger and I'm an avid games enthusiest. I grew up playing board games, card games, video games, even tabletop roleplaying games.
            Ever since I first started playing games, I've also wanted to create them too. If I had to name a life goal, it would be that I want to make the 
            <em>PERFECT</em> game. Not perfect in terms of grphics, or gameplay neccesarily, but perfect in the story it tells. I want to be able to tell a story that 
            isn't possible to tell through any other medium. Truth is, I'm a <strong>storyteller</strong> at heart.
        </p>
